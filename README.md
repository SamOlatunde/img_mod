### Samuel Olatunde 
### Description:

In this assignment, we implement [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MXIGYrMk80) youtube tutorial on visual studio code. The tutorial has us do the following:
* write a Go package that checks to see what mascot you choose
* implement a main.go file to run the mascot package
* create a test to check your package is running correctly

Aditionally, the program uses the quote.go package to print a quote on the console
